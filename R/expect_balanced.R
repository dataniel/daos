#' Assert that a panel is balanced, or has no gaps
#'
#' A checkpoint for register panels: every unit (person, company, workplace)
#' must be observed in every period. Missing unit-periods are the violation
#' set, so a failure lists exactly which units lack which periods. Returns
#' `data`, so it can sit in the middle of a pipeline.
#'
#' Register populations are rarely fully balanced: people are born, die and
#' migrate, and firms open and close. `gaps_only = TRUE` relaxes the rule to
#' what usually *should* hold: a unit may enter late and leave early, but
#' once present it must not skip a period between its first and last. A
#' person present in 2019 and 2021 but missing in 2020 is then a gap; a
#' person first seen in 2021 is not.
#'
#' ## What counts as a period
#'
#' By default the expected periods are those observed anywhere in the data.
#' A period missing for *every* unit (e.g. a year that was never loaded) is
#' therefore invisible. Pass the periods you expect, e.g.
#' `periods = 2015:2024`, to catch that too. Observations outside `periods`
#' are ignored, as are rows with a missing period.
#'
#' Duplicated unit-periods do not make a panel unbalanced, but they are
#' usually an error of their own: check them with
#' [expect_unique()]`(data, id, time)`.
#'
#' The check scales to full-population registers: the unit-period grid is
#' only built for units that actually lack a period.
#'
#' @param id Column(s) identifying the unit (tidy-select), e.g. `cpr` or
#'   `c(cvr, lbnr)`.
#' @param time The period column (one column), e.g. `year`. Any type that
#'   sorts, such as integer years or dates.
#' @param periods Expected periods. Defaults to the periods observed in
#'   `data`.
#' @param gaps_only If `FALSE` (default), every unit must be observed in every
#'   period. If `TRUE`, only periods between a unit's first and last
#'   observation are required.
#' @inheritParams expect_empty
#' @param warn_msg Message shown (and logged) when unit-periods are missing
#'   and no `abort_msg` is set. Defaults to a description of the check.
#'
#' @return `data` invisibly, unchanged.
