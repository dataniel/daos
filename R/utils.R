# Hyperlink a path for cli messages: displays `text` (the path as given by
# default), but links to the absolute path so the link resolves regardless of
# the working directory. RStudio's console only opens file:// links in the
# editor (directories fail silently), so directories become run-links there,
# opening the folder in the file explorer instead. The run-link code must be
# `pkg::fun(args)` from a loaded package -- RStudio refuses anything else,
# including `:::` -- hence the exported open_in_explorer() wrapper. Falls
# back to plain text in terminals without hyperlink support.
